This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, our api key is only for demo test, so we provide in .env.example for quickly setting up.

1. install by pnpm

2. run the docker and migrate 

3. use pnpm run dev to start

Other, 

```bash
copy .env.example to .env 

pnpm i

docker compose up -d

pnpm migrate

pnpm run dev





Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
